# Troubleshooting: Tilt PostGraphile Solution - Complete Fix

## Issue Summary
PostGraphile was not starting up when running `tilt up` in the GitHub Dashboard project. Multiple approaches were tried before finding the correct solution.

## Troubleshooting Steps Taken

### **Approach 1: Manual Kubernetes Deployment**
- **Problem**: Tilt wasn't deploying Kubernetes resources automatically
- **Attempted**: Manual `kubectl apply -f k8s/` to deploy resources
- **Issues Found**: Storage class problems, PostGraphile command syntax, health check failures
- **Result**: Partially worked but required manual intervention

### **Approach 2: Docker Compose Setup**
- **Problem**: Kubernetes approach was too complex and fragile
- **Attempted**: Switched to Docker Compose approach for simpler local development
- **Result**: Simpler but still had PostGraphile as separate service

### **Approach 3: Embedded PostGraphile (Final Solution)**
- **Problem**: PostGraphile running as separate service was causing complexity
- **Solution**: Embedded PostGraphile directly in NestJS application (like client-demographic-api)
- **Result**: ✅ Single process, automatic startup, no manual intervention needed

## Final Solution: Embedded PostGraphile

### **What Was Done**
1. **Added PostGraphile to NestJS**: Embedded PostGraphile middleware directly in `main.ts`
2. **Updated Tiltfile**: Removed separate PostGraphile service, added GraphiQL link to API resource
3. **Cleaned up Kubernetes**: Removed orphaned PostGraphile resources

### **Current Architecture**
- **PostgreSQL**: Running in Kubernetes
- **NestJS API + PostGraphile**: Single process with embedded PostGraphile
- **Web**: Running in Kubernetes
- **Access**: PostGraphile available at `http://localhost:3001/graphql` and `http://localhost:3001/graphiql`

### **Key Changes Made**
1. **packages/github-dashboard/api/src/main.ts**: Added PostGraphile middleware
2. **github-dashboard/Tiltfile**: Updated to use embedded approach with proper links
3. **Root package.json**: Added PostGraphile dependency

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

PostGraphile now starts automatically with the API, matching the client-demographic-api project architecture.
