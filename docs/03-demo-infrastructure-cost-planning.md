## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Architecture

### Resource Categories Identified

1. **Compute Resources**

   - EKS Cluster (container orchestration)
   - Node Groups (Spot instances for cost optimization)
   - Auto Scaling Groups

2. **Data Storage**

   - Aurora PostgreSQL (managed database)
   - S3 Buckets (static assets, exports, backups)
   - EBS Volumes (container storage)

3. **Network & CDN**

   - VPC with public/private subnets
   - Application Load Balancer
   - CloudFront Distribution
   - NAT Gateway

4. **Security & Compliance**

   - KMS Keys (encryption)
   - Secrets Manager (credentials)
   - IAM Roles and Policies
   - Security Groups

5. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - CloudWatch Log Groups
   - CloudWatch Alarms
   - Cost and Billing Alerts

### Environment Configuration

- **Local Development**: Focus on learning and cost analysis (no actual deployment)
- **Scenario 1**: 1K users configuration (cost-optimized)
- **Scenario 2**: 10K users configuration (high availability)

## üí∞ Cost Scenarios to Analyze

### Scenario 1: 1,000 Users/Month (Staging)

- **Target**: Cost-optimized development/staging environment
- **Resources**: Smaller instances, single AZ, minimal redundancy
- **Focus**: Learning and development costs

### Scenario 2: 10,000 Users/Month (Production)

- **Target**: Production-ready with high availability
- **Resources**: Larger instances, multi-AZ, full redundancy
- **Focus**: Production costs and scaling

### Cost Optimization Strategies

- [ ] Spot instances for non-critical workloads
- [ ] Aurora Serverless v2 for variable workloads
- [ ] S3 Intelligent Tiering for storage optimization
- [ ] CloudFront for bandwidth cost reduction
- [ ] Reserved instances for predictable workloads

## üß™ Testing & Validation Plan

### Performance Testing

```bash
# Run performance tests to get realistic estimates
node performance-test.js
```

### Load Testing (tools)

Seeded data assumptions for load tests:

- Clients: Candy Corn Labs (basic) and Haunted Hollow (premium) only (from migrations)
- We scale GitHub users tracked and read/query load; no new clients are created

Commands (run locally):

```bash
# k6 (install with Homebrew):
pnpm --filter @tools/load-testing run k6          # default
pnpm --filter @tools/load-testing run k6:1k       # ~100‚Äì200 concurrent users
pnpm --filter @tools/load-testing run k6:10k      # ~1,000‚Äì2,000 concurrent users

# Artillery (optional; install into the tool package first):
pnpm --filter @tools/load-testing add -D artillery
pnpm --filter @tools/load-testing run artillery
```

Outputs:

- Saved to `packages/github-dashboard/perf-results/` (JSON summaries per tool)
- Capture p95 latency, max RPS, error rate; note DB connection pressure if observable

### Data Generation

```bash
# Generate demo data for storage estimates
node generate-demo-data.js
```

### Terraform Validation

```bash
# Initialize and validate Terraform
cd infrastructure/
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan
```

### Cost Analysis

- Use AWS Calculator for detailed cost estimates
- Compare staging vs production scenarios
- Identify cost optimization opportunities
