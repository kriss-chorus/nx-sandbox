### Environment Configuration

- **Local Development**: Focus on learning and cost analysis (no actual deployment)
- **Scenario 1**: 1K users configuration (cost-optimized)
- **Scenario 2**: 10K users configuration (high availability)

## üí∞ Cost Scenarios to Analyze

### Scenario 1: 1,000 Users/Month (Staging)

- **Target**: Cost-optimized development/staging environment
- **Resources**: Smaller instances, single AZ, minimal redundancy
- **Focus**: Learning and development costs

### Scenario 2: 10,000 Users/Month (Production)

- **Target**: Production-ready with high availability
- **Resources**: Larger instances, multi-AZ, full redundancy
- **Focus**: Production costs and scaling

### Cost Optimization Strategies

- [ ] Spot instances for non-critical workloads
- [ ] Aurora Serverless v2 for variable workloads
- [ ] S3 Intelligent Tiering for storage optimization
- [ ] CloudFront for bandwidth cost reduction
- [ ] Reserved instances for predictable workloads

## üß™ Testing & Validation Plan

### Performance Testing

```bash
# Run performance tests to get realistic estimates
node performance-test.js
```

### Load Testing (tools)

Seeded data assumptions for load tests:

- Clients: Candy Corn Labs (basic) and Haunted Hollow (premium) only (from migrations)
- We scale GitHub users tracked and read/query load; no new clients are created

Commands (run locally):

```bash
# k6 (install with Homebrew):
pnpm --filter @tools/load-testing run k6          # default
pnpm --filter @tools/load-testing run k6:1k       # ~100‚Äì200 concurrent users
pnpm --filter @tools/load-testing run k6:10k      # ~1,000‚Äì2,000 concurrent users

# Artillery (optional; install into the tool package first):
pnpm --filter @tools/load-testing add -D artillery
pnpm --filter @tools/load-testing run artillery
```

Outputs:

- Saved to `packages/github-dashboard/perf-results/` (JSON summaries per tool)
- Capture p95 latency, max RPS, error rate; note DB connection pressure if observable

### Data Generation

```bash
# Generate demo data for storage estimates
node generate-demo-data.js
```

### Terraform Validation

```bash
# Initialize and validate Terraform
cd infrastructure/
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan
```

### Cost Analysis

- Use AWS Calculator for detailed cost estimates
- Compare staging vs production scenarios
- Identify cost optimization opportunities

## üöß Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: GraphQL Mutation Schema Mismatch

**Problem**: k6 load tests were failing with 4 GraphQL errors when trying to create dashboards

```
4 error(s) in 2.38ms :: mutation CreateDashboard($input: CreateDashboardInput!)
```

**Root Cause**: The mutation expected a nested `dashboard` object, not flat fields

```javascript
// ‚ùå Wrong structure
input: {
  name: "Test Dashboard",
  slug: "test-dashboard",
  clientId: "2667d6c1-89e6-4848-8e12-03cefeeec0c8"
}

// ‚úÖ Correct structure
input: {
  dashboard: {
    name: "Test Dashboard",
    slug: "test-dashboard",
    clientId: "2667d6c1-89e6-4848-8e12-03cefeeec0c8"
  }
}
```

**Solution**: Used GraphQL introspection to discover the correct schema structure

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/graphql -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "mutation { createDashboard(input: { dashboard: { ... } }) { ... } }"}'
```

**Learning**: Always validate GraphQL schemas before writing load tests. PostGraphile generates complex nested input types that aren't immediately obvious.

### Challenge 2: Frontend IPv6 Binding Issue (Reoccurring)

**Problem**: Frontend accessible in browser but k6 gets "connection refused" errors

```
time="2025-10-21T20:23:31-07:00" level=warning msg="Request Failed"
error="Get \"http://localhost:4202/\": dial tcp 127.0.0.1:4202: connect: connection refused"
```

**Root Cause**: Frontend service is bound to IPv6 only (`::1:4202`), not IPv4 (`127.0.0.1:4202`)

```bash
# Frontend binding (IPv6 only)
tcp6       0      0  ::1.4202               *.*                    LISTEN

# k6 tries IPv4 first, then fails
* Host localhost:4202 was resolved.
* IPv6: ::1
* IPv4: 127.0.0.1
```

**Investigation Steps**:

1. ‚úÖ Confirmed frontend runs on port 4202: `lsof -i :4202`
2. ‚úÖ Verified single requests work: `curl http://localhost:4202/` returns 200
3. ‚ùå k6 fails because it tries IPv4 (127.0.0.1) first, but service only bound to IPv6 (::1)
4. ‚úÖ Solution: Use IPv6 address directly in k6 test

**Solution**: Use IPv6 address directly in k6 test

```javascript
// ‚ùå Fails - localhost resolves to 127.0.0.1 first
const homepage = http.get('http://localhost:4202/');

// ‚úÖ Works - direct IPv6 address
const homepage = http.get('http://[::1]:4202/');
```

**Learning**: This is a recurring issue that was supposedly fixed but persists. Local development environments often have IPv6/IPv4 binding inconsistencies that don't reflect production behavior. Always check actual network binding with `netstat -an` when debugging connection issues.

### Challenge 3: Data Generation Script Resumability

**Problem**: Running data generation multiple times created duplicate data and errors

```
error: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "github_user_github_user_id_unique"
```

**Root Cause**: Script didn't check for existing data before generating new records

**Solution**: Implemented resumable data generation

```javascript
// Check existing count before generating
const existingCount = await this.client.query(
  "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM github_user WHERE github_username LIKE 'github_user%'"
);
const currentCount = parseInt(existingCount.rows[0].count);

if (currentCount >= count) {
  console.log(`Already have ${currentCount} GitHub users, skipping generation`);
  // Load existing data for relationships
  const existingUsers = await this.client.query(
    "SELECT id FROM github_user WHERE github_username LIKE 'github_user%'"
  );
  this.githubUsers = existingUsers.rows;
  return;
}
```

**Learning**: Always design data generation scripts to be idempotent and resumable. Production data migration scripts should follow the same pattern.

### Challenge 4: Database Schema Understanding

**Problem**: Initial data generation used wrong column names and table relationships

```
error: column "username" of relation "github_user" does not exist
error: column "slug" of relation "dashboard" does not exist
```

**Root Cause**: Assumed schema structure instead of reading actual entity definitions

**Solution**: Read actual Drizzle entity files to understand correct schema

```typescript
// github-user.entity.ts
export const githubUser = pgTable('github_user', {
  githubUserId: varchar('github_user_id', { length: 50 }).notNull().unique(),
  githubUsername: varchar('github_username', { length: 255 }).notNull(),
  // ...
});
```

**Learning**: Always read the actual schema definitions rather than making assumptions. This is especially important with ORMs like Drizzle that have their own naming conventions.

## üéì Key DevOps Insights

### 1. Load Testing Reveals Hidden Constraints

The frontend connection issue under load is actually valuable data for infrastructure planning. It shows that:

- Local development has different capacity limits than production
- We need to consider connection pooling and load balancing
- Single-instance deployments won't scale

### 2. GraphQL Schema Complexity

PostGraphile generates complex nested input types that require careful validation:

- Always use GraphQL introspection to understand schemas
- Test mutations manually before writing load tests
- Consider schema documentation for team knowledge sharing

### 3. Data Generation Strategy

Resumable data generation is crucial for:

- Performance testing iterations
- Development environment setup
- Production data migrations
- CI/CD pipeline reliability

### 4. Local vs Production Differences

Local development environments often hide production concerns:

- Resource constraints (connection limits, memory, CPU)
- Network latency and timeouts
- Concurrent user behavior patterns
- Database connection pooling

This is why load testing is essential - it reveals these hidden constraints before production deployment.
