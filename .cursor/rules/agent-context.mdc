# Agent Context Configuration

## Primary Entry Point

Always start with @AGENT_README.md as the main context entry point before proceeding with any task.

## Context Inclusion

Include the @agent_context/ directory in every conversation to ensure access to:

- Frontend patterns (React, MUI, state management)
- Backend patterns (NestJS, GraphQL, database)
- DevOps patterns (Terraform, AWS, Kubernetes)
- Testing patterns and best practices

## Context Selection Process

1. **First**: Read @AGENT_README.md for task-specific guidance
2. **Then**: Load relevant context files based on the task type
3. **Finally**: Apply the patterns and rules from the loaded context

## Key Rules to Follow

- Use @platform/signature-component-library over MUI when available
- Always use runWithContext for database mutations
- Follow the established patterns in the context files
- Check existing patterns before creating new ones
